> Implemented a browser in JavaScript to demonstrate the interaction between the event loop, callstack, and web API in a browser. <br> The event loop was implemented following the HTML specifications.
<br>



### Description

For implementing function execution in the browser, we represent functions as objects and add them to the call stack.

```javascript
function func1() {
  setTimeout(cb1, 0);
  const promise1 = Promise.resolve().then(cb2);
  const promise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(function cb4() {
      resolve();
    }, 1000);
    func2();
  });
  promise2.then(cb3);
  requestAnimationFrame(cb5);
}
```

This is what an object representation of the function above would look like

```javascript
const executeContext = {
  name: 'func1',
  childFunc: [
    {
      name: 'setTimeout1',
      type: 'macro',
      ms: 0,
      callback: {
        name: 'cb1',
      },
    },
    {
      name: 'promise1',
      type: 'micro',
      resolve: 'promise1',
      callback: {
        name: 'cb2',
      },
    },
    {
      name: 'promise2',
      type: 'micro',
      state: 'pending',
      callback: {
        name: 'cb3',
      },
      childFunc: [
        {
          name: 'setTimeout2',
          type: 'macro',
          ms: 1000,
          callback: {
            name: 'cb4',
            resolve: 'promise2',
          },
        },
        { name: 'func2' },
      ],
    },
    {
      name: 'raf1',
      type: 'raf',
      callback: {
        name: 'cb5',
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

### browser.js (main JS)
```javascript
class Browser {
  constructor() {
    this.callStack = new CallStack();
    this.eventLoop = new EventLoop();
    this.WebAPIThreadPool = new WebAPIThreadPool();
    this.callStack.eventLoop = this.eventLoop;
    this.callStack.WebAPIThreadPool = this.WebAPIThreadPool;
    this.eventLoop.callStack = this.callStack;
    this.WebAPIThreadPool.eventLoop = this.eventLoop;
  }

  start() {
    this.callStack.push(executeContext);

    // After the function finishes executing, you can try to execute it again by entering it in JSON format into the CLI,
    //as demonstrated in the previous example
    // ex) {"name" : "func1" }
    rl.on('line', line => {
      this.callStack.push(JSON.parse(line));
    });
  }
}
const browser = new Browser();
browser.start();
```

Each function object has a common name (name

Function execution within a function is indicated by the childFunc property.

If func2 was executed in func1, then func2 is the childFunc of func1.

Asynchronous functions also use the type property to determine whether they are macro (regular tasks => setimeout, fetch ...), micro (Promise, MutationObserver ...), or requestAnimationFrame (raf).

In this example, the macro task uses only setTimeout and the micro task uses only Promise.

Asynchronous functions have callback functions.

For setTimeout, it has a milliseconds (ms) property.

For Promise, you need to specify where in the scope to resolve to. In the example above, we change promise2 to fullfilled in the callback of setTimeout2. 
The value of the resolve property must match the name of the promise object.

### Usage
```
npm run start
```
When you run the program with the command, you will see the following output.
```
Push context! => func1
Run context! => func1
Push context! => setTimeout1
Run context! => setTimeout1

Complete async & Macro task send to Macrotask queue => cb1
Pop context! => setTimeout1
Push context! => promise1
